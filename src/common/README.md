# Kolatr: Common (common)

A set of common features for Kolatr projects. These features are language agnostic, and aim to provide a consistent set of tools and configurations for all Kolatr projects. This is a wrapper feature, which simply installs other features.

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/kolatr-dev/devcontainer-features/common:1": {}
}
```
